# SemEval-2019

"[SemEval](https://semeval.github.io) is a series of international natural language processing (NLP) research workshops whose mission is to advance the current state of the art in semantic analysis and to help create high-quality annotated datasets in a range of increasingly challenging problems in natural language semantics. Each year’s workshop features a collection of shared tasks in which computational semantic analysis systems designed by different teams are presented and compared."

Projeto desenvolvido durante a cadeira de Processamento de Linguagem Natural (Mestrado em Informática Aplicada com foco em Ciência de Dados e Inteligência Artificial - Universidade de Fortaleza)
